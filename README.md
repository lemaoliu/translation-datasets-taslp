# A Bilingual Corpus for Chinese-English Translation

## Data Description
The bilingual corpus includes news articles collected from several online news websites. After the standard preprocessing procedure by the Moses toolkit, we obtain about 2 million bilingual sentences in total. Then we randomly select 2000 sentences as the development and test datasets, respectively, and leave other sentences as the training dataset.
